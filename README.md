challlenge #3 pyBank and pyPoll

Hello, 


I used information sources from W3schools.com, stackoverflow, youtube, github, gitlab
I also asked many questions from the Xpert learning assistant
I attended available homework office hours before and after class

my tutor assisted me with some of my coding:
   specifically he taught me how to import and set up a counter by using 'from collections import Counter' to collect vote_counts
   as well as introducing me to the 'lambda' function

Thank You
